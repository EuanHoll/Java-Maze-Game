# Java Maze Game

My first ever Java project, made when I was 14 years old. This game uses Javax Swing to display the maze and features a 2D character with collisions. There are 10 levels to complete, with a number of obstacles and cherry pickups throughout the game.

## Installation

To run the game, simply use the provided `.jar` file.

## Usage

The objective of the game is to navigate through the maze and complete all 10 levels. Avoid obstacles and collect cherry pickups to progress through the game.

## Credits

The music for this game was provided by the group "Approaching Nirvana".
